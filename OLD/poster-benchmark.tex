\paragraph{\underline{Benchmark.}}

We developed examples based on the reuse of Scikit-learn artificial intelligent algorithms demonstrations. These examples are then run on different cloud services to create comparative performance benchmarks. We conducted the benchmarks on 
AWS, Azure, and Google. Additional examples conducted on IoT devices and personal computers are discussed in [1]. We also compared the overhead of using the REST services [1].
